# Lithium-Ion-Battery-LDA-
LDA is a dimensionality reduction technique which is commonly used for the supervised classification problems. It is used for modelling differences in groups i.e. separating two or more classes. It is used to project the features in higher dimension space into a lower dimension space. LDA explicitly attempts to model the difference between the classes of data. The PCA model consist of ‘2’ number of components(n_components) followed by a Logistic Regression model.
